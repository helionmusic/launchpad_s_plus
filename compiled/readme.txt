This folder contains both the exported runnable .jar, a wrapped .exe of it and the database file.

Both will require Java Runtime Environment to be installed on the client PC.
Available to download here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html


Also, database file needed to be external to the application in order for it to be editable by the program.
If the database file is moved or renamed, every statistic and high score will load as 0 and 'null'
